                        tree-like structure
                        to perform classification or regression. The algorithm selects the best feature as a node based
                        on information gain or Gini index, and forms branches until it reaches leaf nodes to make final
                        predictions. Decision tree models are simple and interpretable, applicable to various types of
                        data, but may suffer from overfitting.

                        problems. It maps the
                        input features to probability values between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function, representing
                        the probability of a sample belonging to a class. Logistic regression works well for linearly
                        separable data, has low computational cost, but may struggle with non-linear data.

                        learning the parameters of the hidden layers through the backpropagation algorithm, and can
                        effectively solve classification, regression, and other problems. However, MLP requires careful
                        design of network structure and hyperparameters, and the training time can be relatively long.
